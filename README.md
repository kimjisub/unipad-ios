UniPad is a performance-based rhythm game that enables connection with a launchpad and allows users to create their own beatmaps using the unique "unipack" format, fostering creativity and sharing within the community.

## Features

- **UniPack Support**: Load and play custom UniPacks (.zip / .unipack) with sound mapping, LED animations and autoplay sequences.
- **Launchpad & MIDI Support**: Works over USB with automatic detection for:
  - Novation Launchpad S, Mini and MK2
  - Novation Launchpad Pro (Stock firmware)
  - Novation Launchpad Pro (mat1jaczyyy Performance CFW)
  - Novation Launchpad (CoreFW)
  - Novation Launchpad X, Mini MK3 and Pro MK3
  - Midi Fighter 64
  - Mystrix
  - Generic Master Keyboard
- **Custom Themes**: Supports custom skins, pad textures, phantom overlays, chain LEDs and background artwork.
- **Low-Latency Audio**: Multi-channel sound playback built for live performance.
- Built with SwiftUI, SwiftData and CoreMIDI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS / iPadOS 17.0+ device or simulator

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimjisub/unipad-ios.git
cd unipad-ios
```

2. Open the Xcode project:
```bash
open unipad.xcodeproj
```

3. Select your target device or simulator and hit **Run** (`Cmd + R`).

## Pull request checks

Every pull request runs one **iOS checks / Build and unit tests** job on a
GitHub-hosted macOS 15 runner with Xcode 26.3. It builds Release for iOS
Simulator without signing and runs the `unipadTests` target in Debug on an
available iPhone simulator. UI tests are excluded. Dependencies use the
committed `Package.resolved` versions.
The same checks also run after changes are merged into `main`.

The job needs no repository secrets or signing credentials. It replaces the
Firebase plist only in its disposable checkout with clearly fake values from
`ci/firebase_fixture.py`; the existing unit-test runtime uses local Firebase
stubs. App configuration, version, and behavior in normal builds are unchanged.
Build logs and the test result bundle are available in the run's
`ios-check-results` artifact for seven days. This workflow does not upload to
a store or change required checks.

## UI tests

UI tests are not part of the pull request checks. Run the whole `unipadUITests`
target on an iPhone simulator before pushing a change, and attach the result
to the pull request:

```bash
ci/ui-tests.sh <simulator-udid>
```

The script builds Debug without signing and runs every UI test on that
simulator, one at a time. Its last line is the result, for example
`UI tests: 87 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; 87 total; exit 0`. Any failed or
skipped test, or a run without a complete result, gives a non-zero exit. The
log, `UITests.xcresult` and `summary.json` are kept in `build/ui-tests` (set
`UNIPAD_UI_TEST_OUTPUT` to use another folder).

- Use iPhone 17 Pro or iPhone 16e: the layout checks compare against safe areas
  measured independently on those screens.
- Each test launch gets its own library and generates the packs it needs
  (`unipad/App/ReleaseTestSupport.swift`, compiled out of Release builds), so
  packs already on the simulator are neither used nor changed.
- Help checks that need a real Escape key or VoiceOver run through
  `ci/host-keys.sh`, which the script uses. It presses keys through the
  simulator's HID input with a pinned, checksum-verified AXe release. VoiceOver
  checks need Xcode 27 and iOS 27.
- A full run takes about 80–90 minutes. To split it, pass test classes; the
  parts together must name every class:

  ```bash
  ci/ui-tests.sh <simulator-udid> -only-testing:unipadUITests/PackWarningUITests -only-testing:unipadUITests/PlayChainLayoutTests
  ```

## App Store destination check

The separate **App Store link** workflow checks the update URL from
`MainView.swift` daily, on demand, and on pull requests changing the URL or its
checker. It is not a required check. Run it locally from the repository root:

```bash
python3 ci/app_store_link.py --out app-store-link.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s ci -v
```

Exit codes are `0` for a verified UniPad destination, `1` for an invalid link,
and `2` for unavailable network or Apple service (a workflow warning).
The JSON records the original and final URLs, HTTP status, Apple lookup app ID
and name, verdict, and UTC check time. Download the latest
`app-store-link-results` artifact for release checks; it is kept for 90 days.
Offline unit tests run in the existing iOS checks. Live unit tests run only with
`UNIPAD_LIVE_STORE_CHECK=1`.

This verdict concerns the web URL. Simulator opening failures do not indicate
an invalid link: simulators lack the App Store app and may open Safari instead.
`--simulator <udid>` records `simctl openurl` diagnostics separately without
changing the verdict. `--source <file>` and `--expected-id <number>` allow
checking a different source or expected app ID.

## Connecting a Launchpad

1. Connect your Launchpad to your device using a USB adapter or USB-C cable.
2. Open UniPad. The app scans and connects to supported hardware automatically.
3. If you want to change drivers manually, you can pick one from the in-app MIDI menu.

## Project Layout

- `unipad/App`: App entry point and navigation routing
- `unipad/Services/MIDI`: CoreMIDI communication, device drivers and SysEx handling
- `unipad/Services/Audio`: Sound playback engine and audio pool
- `unipad/Services/LED`: LED frame runner and light mapping
- `unipad/Services/Theme`: Theme loader and zip extraction
- `unipad/Database`: SwiftData models for saved unipacks
- `unipad/Views`: UI screens (grid player, store, settings, theme picker, midi picker)
